Road Block: The leftmost block represent the road that monsters can walk through and you can also build short-range tower to prevent the enemy from advancing.

Decoration Block: The block with forests and  windmill just serves as a decoration of the map ( just for fun).

Birth Place and Target Place: The block which contains a red round represents  the birth place of the monsters  and the rightmost stands for the dream that you should defend and avoid the enemies to inter.



notice:

You should guarantee that the two points  (from the birth place to target place)  are connected by a path or the game will give out an error notice:
